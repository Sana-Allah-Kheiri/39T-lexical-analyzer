# 39T-lexical-analyzer
This lexical analyzer can identify 39 tokens that we have defined as our keywords for a presumed programming language.
🤔 So how to use 39t⁉
1️⃣ Before executing the 39TLA, you need to copy your text file to this path: ~/x64/Debug/ where the exe file exists  
💡 The .txt file includs any character and also reserved key words for 39-token programming language whose key words are provided below 👇🏻
-program
-is
-begin
-end
-var
-int
-boolean
-read
-write
-if
-then
-else
-while
-do
-or
-and
-true
-false
-not

🕑 Open .exe file and type your txt file name with .txt afterwards.

🕒 Now you see which tokens are invalid(Error) and which are recognized as reserved key word!
Please let me know what else can make this simple lexical analyzer more handy!
